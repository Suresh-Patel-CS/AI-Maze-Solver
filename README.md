# AI-Maze-Solver
 a fully functioning Maze solver and Generator that would create a random 51x51 mazes with a fire that would spread from the center after every round and agents must avoid the fire while they attempt to solve the maze.
∗ Developed 6 different agents each using a unique algorithm to clear the maze.
∗ Implemented searching algorithms Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, A*
